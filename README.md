📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the resale value of used cars based on multiple features such as:
- Car Name  
- Year of Manufacture  
- Fuel Type  
- Kilometers Driven  
- City  
- Body Type  
- Transmission  
- Number of Owners  

The prediction model is built using XGBoost and deployed as an interactive Streamlit Dashboard.  
Additionally, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is performed to identify market insights.
